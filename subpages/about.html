            Ever since I was a kid, I have always enjoyed being creative. I loved drawing 
            and finding new ways to express myself creatively. Because of that, I picked
            up drawing and painting seriously in 2021, finding my own unique ways to 
            express myself. My area of expertise lies in sketching and illustration.
            I am a primarily traditional artist, with preference for drawing in pencil and ink,
            as well as painting in gouache and watercolor. However, I also enjoy drawing digitally,
            primarily in Krita and Clip Studio Paint.

            In high school, I picked up photography as a way to capture the beauty of our world.
            I specialized in urban photography, inspired by the city of Moscow, where I grew up.
            I have experience with Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, as well as other photo editing
            programs. Furthermore, I tried myself at graphic design with Adobe Illustrator.
            Other programs I am familiar with include Affinity Photo and Designer.

            I am an avid gamer ever since I was 4 years old. I enjoy video games for their ability
            to offer a wide range of unique experiences, as games can bring people together, tell
            compelling stories, or be drivers for social change. My favorite games of all time include
            Half-Life, Metal Gear Solid, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Terraria, Cave Story,
            Undertale and Fire Emblem: Three Houses. These games are important to me as they played
            an important part in helping me discover my passions and interests, and they inspire me
            to create my own stories and experiences that can mean something to others.

            My family has a long history of travelling. I was born in Russia, but since 2016 I have been
            living in sunny San Diego in Southern California. I enjoy learning about other cultures and
            visiting foreign countries, and I also am fascinated by the diversity of human languages. This
            is the reason I pursued a degree in Linguistics at UC San Diego: I wanted to learn more about 
            what makes language so important to humanity, and how we always find unique ways to express 
            ourselves.
