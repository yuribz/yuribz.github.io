        <p>
            On this page, you will find links to various projects that I made. <br>
            My language of choice is Python due to my familiarity with it, the ease of 
            development, and a big choice of libraries and platforms. However, I also 
            enjoy creating projects in Java and Godot, and I am also learning C and C#.
